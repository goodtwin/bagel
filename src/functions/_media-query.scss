 * Media query mixin.
 *
 * It’s not great practice to define solid breakpoints up-front, preferring to
 * modify your design when it needs it, rather than assuming you’ll want a
 * change at ‘mobile’. However, as inuit.css is required to take a hands off
 * approach to design decisions, this is the closest we can get to baked-in
 * responsiveness. It’s flexible enough to allow you to set your own breakpoints
 * but solid enough to be frameworkified.
 *
 * We define some broad breakpoints in our vars file that are picked up here
 * for use in a simple media query mixin. Our options are:
 *
 * palm
 * lap
 * lap-and-up
 * portable
 * desk
 * desk-wide
 *
 * Not using a media query will, naturally, serve styles to all devices.
 *
 * `@include media-query(palm){ [styles here] }`
 *
 * We work out your end points for you:

@mixin media-query($mq) {

    // Loop through the list of breakpoints we’ve provided in our settings file.
    @each $alias, $condition in $breakpoints {

        // If the media query we’ve specified has an alias and a condition...
        @if $mq == $alias and $condition {

            // ... spit it out here.
            @media #{$condition} {
                @content;
            }

        }

    }
